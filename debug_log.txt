    11-21-2023 5:29AM  I missed my parentheses in line 36 of 'branches2'.  Was this causing mySong.Trn.finished to 
revert to 'True'?  It needs to be False until the recording is finished.
In the 'else' section of 'branches2...random short form()' i found a misplaced 'create_remaining_notes()'
that I called too early.  Could this explain the divergence in the total note counts between instance and transcript? 
I also found a line that changed mySong.Trn.transcript to True.  Is it too early???
In 'branches2' i found when checking the length of my 'eachVoice' that they were empty lists!  Was this causing my 
boolean 'finished' to change to True???  
I can't seem to get python to recognize my 'tones for 1st instrument' when checking length of voice....
I tried a nested forLoop but it claims it's a 'tone object' and won't budge.  the empty lists of 
instruments 2-5 work just fine but of course they don't count as a numerical length but rather as empty lists.
Okay...now it counts....why???  does python prefer formatted strings?  or does python prefer that i counted
it at the beginning of the function rather than during the 'else' statement??
    6:35AM why does my 'generate_notes' skip while the counter is still at 27?
    I think I found a major problem with my understanding of memory access and 'global' variables...
    !!! I mistakenly placed my mySong.Trn functions as indents inside of my Trn class.  Bad move!!!

    11-21-2023 11:41AM in line 35 of 'branches2' i found a forLoop that probably needs to be self-contained
rather than passing through the mainLoop.  It was regarding 'eachVoice'.

    11-23-2023 11:58AM  I am debating how to use 'plot_notes' along with the 'pni...current_plot' system
to effectively number and count and transcribe what will ultimately by used on the screen.
